# Project Overview

This repository is a collection of JavaScript code examples and notes created for the purpose of studying the core concepts of JavaScript. It is not a runnable application but rather a resource for learning and reference. The content is based on the book "Core JavaScript" and covers fundamental topics such as data types, execution context, `this`, callbacks, closures, and prototypes.

The code is written in a clear and well-commented style, with each file focusing on a specific concept and providing practical examples.

## Development Conventions

* **Language:** JavaScript (ES5 and ES6)
* **Style:** The code is well-documented with JSDoc-style comments, explaining the purpose of each file, section, and example.
* **File Structure:** The project is organized into directories, each corresponding to a chapter or a major topic from the "Core JavaScript" book.
* **Linting:** The project uses `@biomejs/biome` for code formatting and linting.

## Key Files

* `readme.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and the topics covered.
* `documents/`: Contains markdown files with notes and summaries of the JavaScript concepts.
* `callback/`, `execution_context/`, `this/`: These directories contain JavaScript files with code examples for each topic.
* `package.json`: Defines the project's metadata and development dependencies.

## Usage

This repository is intended for self-study. You can read the code, run individual files with Node.js to see the output, and experiment with the examples to deepen your understanding of JavaScript.

For example, to run a specific file, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node execution_context/hoinsting.js
```
